Mr Ong is very humourous and makes his lessons fun and enjoyable. As sometimes Chemistry may get boring, he constantly cracks very lame chemistry jokes such as telling us that he wanted to tell us a joke but all the jokes ARGON (are gone) (although we may not react) and likes to explain concepts to us in a creative manner. He is also very inclusive and active in class, constantly moving around so that we would be able to see how does the molecules move about virtually, helping us understand concepts even better. Many of us like his lessons very much and were quite sad that he had to leave for course.
