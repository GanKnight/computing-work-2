Ms Lee seems to be very strict at first, but as we got to know her, she is actually quite funny and relaxed. As long as we do not waste time walking to the venue and pay attention during lessons, she will not scold us.
During the first PE lesson of the year, many of us wasted a lot of time changing into our PE attires, and we got scolded for wasting the precious one hour we have weekly. Hence, our first impressions of Ms Lee were not very positive. 
However, during a PE lesson where we had to decide between shotput and long jump, only a minority of us, including me, chose shotput, which Ms Lee was in charge of. She jokingly said that we were the "smartest amongst the whole class", as a small group meant that we would be able to finish the competition quickly and could be dismissed for recess early. Having fun and doing everything relaxingly, we still completed our tasks with around twenty minutes left. Ms Lee happily dimissed us and we had an hour of recess, while the other group even had to delay their recess by ten minutes due to the large number of people in their group. From that lesson, I realised that Ms Lee was not as strict as all of us had imagined.
